- Secure user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for the login feature.
- Ability to display videos sorted by most views and play videos after logging in.
- Commenting functionality for users to interact and discuss videos.

## üß† Challenges Faced

- Crafting a compelling UI/UX design, as I embarked on using design tools for the first time.
- Implementing user authentication and login functionality using JSON Web Tokens.
- A minor setback was encountered, which caused a brief delay in the deployment schedule.

## üåê Application Workflow

1. Upon launching the application, video data from the database is showcased.
2. Sort videos by most viewers with a single click on the "Most Viewed" button.
3. Experience enhanced video interaction after creating an account and logging in.
4. Engage in vibrant discussions by posting comments on videos.
5. Conveniently access product links from the left section of the application.
6. Seamlessly log out, returning to the home page without disruption.

## üôè Acknowledgments

I extend my sincere apologies if certain feature requirements or deployment timelines weren't met the requirements for the persistent 3.0 generation final project task. Your time and consideration are greatly appreciated as you explore this repository.
